The failure by IPTV Player or any third-party beneficiary to enforce any provision of the Agreements shall not waive their right to do so. The terms &quot;include&quot; and &quot;including,&quot; and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words &quot;without limitation.&quot;</p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>You agree to indemnify and hold IPTV Player harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs, arising out of or related to your breach of the Agreements, your User Content contributions, your activities on or through the IPTV Player Application, and your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.</p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>The Agreements, including any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them, are subject to the laws, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law principles. The Arbitration Agreement as explained in paragraph 22 applies to all users.</p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION</strong></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>You and IPTV Player agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and IPTV Player arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or your relationship with IPTV Player as a user of the Application will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court, and there is no judge or jury in arbitration. Court review of an arbitration award is limited, and there may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including attorney fees, except that the arbitrator may not award any relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.</p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>You and IPTV Player agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action. No arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person&apos;s claims or preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party&apos;s individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of these limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.</p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Either you or IPTV Player may start arbitration proceedings, and any arbitration between you and IPTV Player will take place in accordance with the prevailing laws, as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&apos;s ruling on the merits. All disputes arising under this agreement shall be submitted to the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce and settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules.</p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>If either party intends to seek arbitration, they must first send a written Notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or electronic mail. The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and set forth the specific relief sought. Both parties agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if they do not reach an agreement within 30 days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by either party shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used for any purpose other than for the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator&apos;s decision and award, except as required by applicable law.</p>
